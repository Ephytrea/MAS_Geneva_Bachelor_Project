# MAS_Geneva_Bachelor_Project

In this repository you will find the content of the code for the "Multi-agent systems, the exploration-exploitation dilemma." Bachelor project.
Used only as a repository, comments are already made in the code, and if clarifications were needed, this repository would probably not be updated but feel free to contact me by mail.

Concerning the data folders, i would advise you to stick to the data_processing file to understand them, some informations are lost to time and even i would not be able to get them back, but this serves essentialy as work documentation purpose as most of the generations i did are stored here and not removed. As said before, if more informations are needed and not found in my work, feel free to contact me by mail.
